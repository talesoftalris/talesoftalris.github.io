        The Tales of Talris
        <p>
            After a long time of pondering, our team has decided to make a survival horror-like game filled with riddles called <b>The Tales of Talris</b>. Why <b>The Tales of Talris</b> you might ask ? Well, it pretty much is because we initially had not a lot of inspiration so we decided to take a general game name that would adapt itself with most of video games genres, and as for <b>Talris</b> we simply found it on a fantasy names generator.

                <b>Survival horror</b> is a subgenre of video game greatly inspired by horror fiction. It focuses on setting up a scary and stressful ambiance all along the game, as the player has to focus on making sure the main character he controls survives thoughout the play and as the game tries to frighten him with jump scares.  Although combat can be part of the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.
