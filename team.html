I attended all of my middle school and high school years at Janson de Sailly, located in the 16th district of Paris and known for being the largest city school of France with more than 3850 students from Year 6 all over to second year of preparatory classes. I have recently gotten my high school diploma in Sciences (specialized in Biology and with the option Mathematics) with the honors 'Very Good'. Also, I have studied Chinese as my first language for 7 years in the International Chinese section of the school

                                    <p class="card-text"> Originally, even all the way through Year 12, I did not know yet what to do and in which field I wanted to work in the future. Last year, when we had to fill in Parcoursup the schools we wanted be in, I was so lost that I was hesitating between putting either medical studies, scientific preparatory classes, UIT and different universities, basically any type of study that could exist. But that is when a friend of mine brought me to one of EPITA's open day that was held around the beginning of 2018, and I launched myself in a field I have considered in the past but never dared to think or practice furthermore: Computer Science. So here I am now, ready to make a whole video game from scratch with my three other workmates, and that is something the past 'me' would have never think of.
