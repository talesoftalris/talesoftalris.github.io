                                <p class="card-text">I remember back when I was young, I used to love to just operate
                                    our family’s computer. Opening up Command Prompt and make it
                                    say the date and time. Then when Windows XP was out, I would
                                    play around with the themes and such. I was fascinated by it. To be
                                    honest, it wasn’t just computers that fascinated me, just machines in
                                    general did.
                            </p>
                                   <p class="card-text"> That fire of interest in machines never died out. And to this day
                                    the fire is growing. As I grew to an age where hobbies were our world,
                                    I played with R/C cars. And when they broke, I used to open it up
                                    and try to fix it. Failed most of the time, as I would never understood
                                    how the circuits worked, but I learned. So making a game is the perfect
                                    thing for me!
                                   </p>
                                    <p class="card-text">When internet came along, I couldn’t handle the amount of things I
                                    could do! First, I obviously had to learn about video games, and that’s
                                    where another fire in my heart started, this time for video games. I
                                    learned how to act on the internet, tips and tricks that made everyone
                                    blow their minds, and most importantly, how to code websites! Then,
                                    in school, we were introduced to the world of programming with Java,
                                    and that’s how I got into this.
                                </p>
                                    <p class="card-text"> I gathered some friends who were also interested in setting up a
                                    server. We learned that it is not very easy even to maintain such a small
                                    company. But that also taught me the importance of keeping a group
                                    alive and functional, and that’s what I will do in this group! I shall
                                    be their personal psychiatrist.

I attended all of my middle school and high school years at Janson de Sailly, located in the 16th district of Paris and known for being the largest city school of France with more than 3850 students from Year 6 all over to second year of preparatory classes. I have recently gotten my high school diploma in Sciences (specialized in Biology and with the option Mathematics) with the honors 'Very Good'. Also, I have studied Chinese as my first language for 7 years in the International Chinese section of the school

                                    <p class="card-text"> Originally, even all the way through Year 12, I did not know yet what to do and in which field I wanted to work in the future. Last year, when we had to fill in Parcoursup the schools we wanted be in, I was so lost that I was hesitating between putting either medical studies, scientific preparatory classes, UIT and different universities, basically any type of study that could exist. But that is when a friend of mine brought me to one of EPITA's open day that was held around the beginning of 2018, and I launched myself in a field I have considered in the past but never dared to think or practice furthermore: Computer Science. So here I am now, ready to make a whole video game from scratch with my three other workmates, and that is something the past 'me' would have never think of.

                                        secondary school and a private high school, so at this point Epita does not
                                        change so much for me. I have gotten my high school diploma in Sciences
                                        with a specialization in Physics and I got the honors “Good”.

                                       <p class="card-text"> I have always known I wanted to study Computer Sciences. In fact, it is
                                        mainly thanks to my father who worked as an Engineer in Systems and
                                        Networking. I pretty much got the feeling I wanted to do this at the age of
                                        6 or 7. So when I was growing up I already knew it would be IT but I then
                                        had to determine which formation I would take.
                                       </p>
                                        <p class="card-text">At that time, a friend of mine told me he joined the school called Epitech, so
                                            it was perfect: I had a name to start with. And from that I started doing my
                                            own research and discovered Epita which was much more in accordance with
                                            my projects. Well still, in the last year of high school I attended many open
                                            days to compare the different schools there were in Paris (or close to. . . like
                                            here in Villejuif, right ?). In the end, the school I wanted to go to was still
                                            Epita, and on ParcourSup the other ones pretty much became spare choices
                                            just in case. And now here I am, in Epita, about to start my very first IT
                                            project with my three other workmates. Let the fun begin !
